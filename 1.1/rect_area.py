# Calculating the Area of a Rectangle

# 1. Write a program in Python that calculates the area of a rectangle. 
# Use this formula: area = hw. Your program will have in-line documentation (a header and in-line comments). 
# Output your answer in meters. Name your program rect_area.py

print("This program will calculate the area of a rectangle.")

# Input for Height and Width
h = int (input("Height: "))
w = int(input("Width: "))

# Output Area
print("Area =", h*w, "meters squared")
