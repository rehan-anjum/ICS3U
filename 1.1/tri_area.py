# Calculating the Area of a Triangle

# 3. Write a program in Python that calculates the area of a triangle. 
# Use this formula: area = Â½bh. Your program will have in-line documentation (a header and in-line comments). 
# Output your answer in meters. Name your program tri_area.py

print("This program will calculate the area of a triangle.")

# Input for Base and Height
b = int(input("Base: "))
h = int (input("Height: "))

# Output Area
print("Area =", 0.5*b*h, "meters squared")
