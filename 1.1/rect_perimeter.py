# Calculating the Perimeter of a Rectangle

# 2. Write a program in Python that calculates the perimeter of a rectangle. 
# Use this formula: perimeter = 2h + 2w. Your program will have in-line documentation (a header and in-line comments). 
# Output your answer in meters. Name your program rect_perimeter.py

print("This program will calculate the perimeter of a rectangle.")

# Input for Height and Width
h = int (input("Height: "))
w = int(input("Width: "))

# Output Perimeter
print("Perimeter =", (2*h)+(2*w), "meters")
